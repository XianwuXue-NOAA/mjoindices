Some of the tests need input and reference data to be executable. This concerns particularly the integration tests,
which recalculate a complete OMI time series and compare the results with the original values.

The input and reference datasets are not included in the software package, but can be downloaded separately from Zenodo:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3746562

Download and extract one of the files found there and copy the contents into the local test/testdata directory,
so that it has additionally the following contents afterwards:
tests/testdata/olr.day.mean.nc
tests/testdata/OriginalOMI/eof1/eof*.txt
tests/testdata/OriginalOMI/eof2/eof*.txt
tests/testdata/OriginalOMI/omi.1x.txt
tests/testdata/OriginalOMI/omi_var.txt

Note that it is not reliable to perform the tests with respective files directly downloaded from the website of NOAA,
since those files might be changed, whereas the recalculation depends on a particular snapshot.
